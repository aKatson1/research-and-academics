# Research and Academics
This repository documents my exploration of the mathematical foundations behind AI and related fields.

**Focus Areas**
- Optimization (gradient descent, convexity, convergence)
- Linear algebra and geometry of ML (PCA, SVD)
- Statistical learning theory
- Abstract algebra, topology, and their connections to data science
- Research projects (e.g., H-Orbit decomposition, group theory)

**Tools**
Python (NumPy, SymPy), Maple, LaTeX, Jupyter Notebook

**Purpose**
To deepen understanding of the mathematics driving modern machine learning and prepare for research in AI engineering.
